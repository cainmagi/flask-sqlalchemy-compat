This demo works totally the same as the [Lite demo](./flask-sqlalchemy-lite.mdx). In
other words, its APIs and features are totally the same as those of that demo. The only
differences are:

1. The default backend is powered by Flask SQLAlchemy.
2. In the codes, we prefer to use the old-style database APIs provided by Flask
   SQLAlchemy.

## Database structure

The entity-relationship diagram (ERD) of the database is also the same:

<div className="mb-default center w-60">
  <ThemedImage
    alt="ERD of the regular application demo"
    sources={{
      light: useBaseUrl("/img/examples/erd-fsql-light.svg"),
      dark: useBaseUrl("/img/examples/erd-fsql-dark.svg"),
    }}
  />
</div>

Compared to the demo of the lite version, this demo has such different features:

- The default database backend is Flask SQLAlchemy. If the regular version is not
  available, fall back to Flask SQLAlchemy Lite.
- For each object-relationship mapping (ORM) model, benefiting from the enhancement
  of Flask SQLAlchemy, we do not need to manually specify `__tablename__`.
- The following APIs

  - `db.session.execute(sa.select(...))`
  - `db.session.query(...)`

  are replaced by the old-style APIs like `Model.query`. Such usages are provided by
  Flask SQLAlchemy.

- The ID-based entity locating is implemented by `db.get_or_404(...)` rather than
  `db.session.get(...)`. This `get_or_404(...)` method is provided by Flask SQLAlchemy.
  It will not return `None` but throw a 404 abort when the model is not found.

## Access the demo

Use the same testing scripts in the
[Lite demo](./flask-sqlalchemy-lite.mdx#access-the-demo) because the implementation
of this demo has totally the same APIs of that one.
